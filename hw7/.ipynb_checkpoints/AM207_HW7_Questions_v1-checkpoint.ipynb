    "The [*MNIST* dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is one of the classic datasets in Machine Learning and is often one of the first datasets against which new classification algorithms test themselves.

You will be using PyTorch to build a handwritten digit classifier that you will train, validate, and test with MNIST. \n",

    "The multilayer perceptron can be understood as a logistic regression classifier in which the input is first transformed using a learnt non-linear transformation. The non-linear transformation is often chosen to be either the logistic function or the $\\tanh$ function or the RELU function, and its purpose is to project the data into a space where it becomes linearly separable. The output of this so-called hidden layer is then passed to the logistic regression graph that we have constructed in the first problem. \n",

    "2.2. The initialization of the weights matrix for the hidden layer must assure that the units (neurons) of the perceptron operate in a regime where information gets propagated. For the $\\tanh$ function, you may find it advisable to initialize with the interval $\\left[-\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}\\right]$, where $fan_{in}$ is the number of units in the $(i-1)$-th layer, and $fan_{out}$ is the number of units in the i-th layer.
